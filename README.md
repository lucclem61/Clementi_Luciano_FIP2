FIP Term 2
This is The Final integrated project for Term 2 of Interactive Media Design.

About:
This is my three page website to promote the re-branding of the "Burple" soda. It consists of a Home page, a Products page and a Contact form page. The website contains 2 sets of animations, an originally  designed animated GIF on the Products page and a promotional video on the Home page.

Animations:
-On the products page when you hover over any of the cans they will wobble and rotate and will stop when you remove the cursor.
-On the Contact page when you type in your name, animated text will fall down from the top of the page saying "Nice to meet you!".

Clickable Links: 
Home page: in the header ("Home" "Products" "Contact") in the second text box("Products") in the last text box("Contact")
Products page: in the header ("Home" "Products" "Contact") in all text box's ("Contact")
